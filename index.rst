Abstract
========

As one of the operating partners for Rubin Operations, SLAC is responsible for the stewardship of the LSST Camera: SLAC staff will provide scientific and technical support for LSST Cam operations at the Summit Facility in Chile, and SLAC Observing Specialists will perform night-time operations both on-site and remotely. To fulfill these obligations, SLAC will need (and has budgeted for) a remote observing room (providing a direct video link and mirrored views of the observatory controls at the Rubin Summit Facility), and associated collaboration space. In this design document we derive the specifications of this remote observing room as the central component of a more general, multi-purpose Rubin Operations Center, situated in the 1st floor of the Kavli Building at SLAC. This Center will support collaboration by others in the Rubin Operations team (including the staff processing the LSST image data at the Rubin US Data Facility), and with members of the LSST Dark Enerrgy Science Collaboration. It will also act as a hub for the wider KIPAC community as it does science with the LSST data, and be a major destination for visitors on lab tours and other public outreach events.
