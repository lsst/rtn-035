###################################
The Rubin Operations Center at SLAC
###################################

RTN-035
=======

As one of the operating partners for Rubin Operations, SLAC is responsible for the stewardship of the LSST Camera: SLAC staff will provide scientific and technical support for LSST Cam operations at the Summit Facility in Chile, and SLAC Observing Specialists will perform night-time operations both on-site and remotely. 
To fulfill these obligations, SLAC will need, and has budgeted for, a remote observing room and some associated collaboration space.
The SLAC Control Room will provide a direct video link and mirrored views of the observatory controls at the Rubin Summit Facility, in the same way that the Base Facility Control Room in La Serena, and the Tucson Control Room, each do.

In this design document we derive the specifications of the SLAC Control Room as the central component of a more general, multi-purpose Rubin Operations Center, situated in the 1st floor of the Kavli Building at SLAC. This Center will support collaboration by others in the Rubin Operations team (including the staff processing the LSST image data at the Rubin US Data Facility), and with members of the LSST Dark Enerrgy Science Collaboration. It will also act as a hub for the wider KIPAC community as it does science with the LSST data, and be a major destination for visitors on lab tours and other public outreach events.

Status
------
This draft technote is a working design document, which the authors are using to derive the requirements of the SLAC Control Room and its surrounding collaboration and visitor space.
It will eventually become a document recording the design decisions made.

*Most recent update: includes input on Control Room requirements from Stuart and Tony following their visit to La Serena and Cerro Pachon.*
